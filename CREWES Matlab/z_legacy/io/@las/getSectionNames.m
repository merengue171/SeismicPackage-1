function ca = getSectionNames( obj, sn )
%
%function ca = getSectionName( obj, sn )
% Returns cell array(s) selected from obj.sections based on indices
% contained in sn (if numeric) or on case-invariant matches between 
% section names in obj.sections and the contents of sn (char or cellstr).
%
% Note that this function can return the contents of more than one section:
% eg. sn='~log' could match '~log_parameter','~log_definition','~log_data',
% etc.
%
% If no matches to sn are found in the object, getSectionName returns an empty
% cell array
